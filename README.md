## 📄Abstract

> Corn is one of the most widely cultivated crops globally, yet it remains highly susceptible to a variety of diseases. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, image-based methods for corn disease classification have emerged and achieved promising results. However, many existing approaches still face challenges such as reliance on single-source information and limited feature extraction capacity. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-modal model named CEA-Net. First, we introduce a Cross-layer Connection Model (CCM) for image processing, which integrates multi-level wavelet blocks, VMamba, and Transformer components through a cross-layer connectivity mechanism. This design enhances spatial information reorganization and facilitates efficient feature extraction and reuse within the visual backbone network. Second, we propose an Efficient Dynamic Attention Fusion (EDAF) module for multi-modal feature fusion. EDAF dynamically modulates the contribution of each modality, emphasizing dominant sources while efficiently enhancing the representational capability of feature maps. Finally, we introduce Adaptive Adversarial Cross-Entropy Meta-learning (AACEM) for model pre-training. By combining meta learning with sharpness-aware minimization and utilizing adaptive adversarial cross entropy loss, AACEM improves both generalization and overall performance. Experimental results show that CEA-Net achieves an accuracy of 97.40%, outperforming networks such as EfficientViM and D2R by margins of 0.81%, 0.56%, 0.67%, and 0.55% across various metrics, demonstrating its significant practical value in corn disease management.
